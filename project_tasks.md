### Project: Build a Network Sniffer

#### **Objective**
Create a Python-based tool to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. The sniffer should allow filtering specific types of packets and save the captured data for further inspection.

---

### **Tasks**

1. **Set Up the Environment**
   - Install the necessary libraries and dependencies (e.g., Scapy or equivalent).
   - Ensure the application is run with appropriate privileges (admin/root).

2. **Design the Sniffer**
   - Decide on a user interface (e.g., CLI or a lightweight GUI using Tkinter or PyQt).
   - Allow the user to input filtering parameters (e.g., protocol type, source/destination IP, port).
   - Choose how you will display captured packets (live in the terminal or save them to a file).

3. **Capture Network Traffic**
   - Capture packets in real-time.
   - Apply user-defined filters (e.g., capture only TCP packets on port 80 or ICMP packets).
   - Allow raw packet data capture for offline inspection.

4. **Parse Packet Data**
   - Decode and display key information from captured packets, such as:
     - Source/Destination IP and Port
     - Packet size
     - Protocol type
     - Payload contents (when applicable)
   - Highlight abnormal traffic patterns or specific flags (e.g., SYN floods or ARP requests).

5. **Implement Logging**
   - Save captured packets to a **.pcap** file for offline analysis using tools like Wireshark.
   - Optionally, create a simple text-based log with summaries of each captured packet.

6. **Add Filtering Options**
   - Implement basic filtering capabilities (e.g., by protocol, IP range, or port).
   - Allow real-time or predefined filters.

7. **Test the Sniffer**
   - Test the tool in a controlled environment:
     - Use simulated traffic (e.g., sending ICMP packets using `ping` or TCP traffic using tools like `curl`).
     - Verify it correctly filters, captures, and logs relevant traffic.
   - Test against real-world scenarios, such as monitoring HTTP traffic or diagnosing local network issues.

8. **Optimize Performance**
   - Ensure minimal impact on the network or system resources while sniffing.
   - Implement a timeout or packet count limit to prevent excessive resource usage.

9. **Add an Analysis Feature (Optional)**
   - Add basic traffic analysis, such as:
     - Counting the number of packets per protocol.
     - Identifying suspicious activity (e.g., frequent ARP requests or unusually large packets).
     - Detecting anomalies like out-of-sequence TCP packets.

10. **Document the Tool**
    - Write clear instructions for setting up and running the sniffer.
    - Provide examples of common use cases, such as capturing HTTP traffic or diagnosing DNS issues.

### **Deliverables**
- A functional Python-based network sniffer.
- A user manual or README file describing how to use it.
- Sample output files (e.g., captured packets in `.pcap` format or text logs).

---

### **Real-World Applications**
- Troubleshooting network connectivity issues.
- Monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity.
- Learning how various network protocols behave.
- Preparing for advanced topics in cybersecurity, such as intrusion detection or penetration testing.
