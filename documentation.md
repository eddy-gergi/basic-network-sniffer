## Scapy Documentation for Python

### Overview
**Scapy** is a Python library used for:

- **Packet crafting:** Create and manipulate network packets.
- **Packet sniffing:** Capture packets from a network.
- **Protocol analysis:** Understand and decode various network protocols.
- **Network testing:** Build custom tools for penetration testing, troubleshooting, or monitoring.

---

### Installation
You can install Scapy using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

For extended functionality (e.g., graphical output), you might also need to install additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pyx
```

---

### Basic Usage

#### Importing Scapy
Start by importing the library:
```python
from scapy.all import *
```

#### Sending and Receiving Packets
Scapy enables easy crafting, sending, and sniffing of packets.

- **Sending Packets**
  ```python
  send(IP(dst="192.168.1.1")/ICMP())
  ```

- **Receiving Packets**
  ```python
  sniff(filter="icmp", prn=lambda x: x.show())
  ```

- **Sending and Receiving**
  ```python
  sr1(IP(dst="192.168.1.1")/ICMP())
  ```

---

### Packet Crafting
Scapy allows crafting packets at any OSI layer.

#### Example: Creating an ICMP Packet
```python
packet = IP(dst="8.8.8.8")/ICMP()
packet.show()  # Display packet details
```

#### Example: Sending a TCP SYN Packet
```python
packet = IP(dst="192.168.1.1")/TCP(dport=80, flags="S")
send(packet)
```

---

### Packet Sniffing
Scapy can sniff network traffic based on various filters.

#### Example: Capturing All Packets
```python
packets = sniff(count=10)
packets.summary()
```

#### Example: Filtering for HTTP Traffic
```python
packets = sniff(filter="tcp port 80", count=5)
packets.show()
```

#### Example: Writing to a File
```python
packets = sniff(count=10)
wrpcap("packets.pcap", packets)
```

#### Example: Reading from a File
```python
packets = rdpcap("packets.pcap")
for packet in packets:
    packet.show()
```

---

### Protocol Layers
Scapy supports a variety of protocols and layers, such as:

- **Ethernet Layer**
  ```python
  Ether()
  ```

- **IP Layer**
  ```python
  IP(dst="8.8.8.8")
  ```

- **TCP/UDP Layers**
  ```python
  TCP(dport=80)
  UDP(dport=53)
  ```

- **Custom Protocol Stacking**
  ```python
  packet = Ether()/IP(dst="192.168.1.1")/TCP(dport=80)
  packet.show()
  ```

---

### Advanced Features

#### ARP Spoofing Example
```python
packet = ARP(op=2, pdst="192.168.1.100", hwdst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff", psrc="192.168.1.1")
send(packet, loop=1, inter=2)
```

#### DNS Query Example
```python
packet = IP(dst="8.8.8.8")/UDP(dport=53)/DNS(rd=1, qd=DNSQR(qname="example.com"))
response = sr1(packet)
response.show()
```

#### Traceroute Example
```python
result, unanswered = traceroute(["8.8.8.8", "1.1.1.1"])
```

---

### Debugging and Logs
Scapy provides various debugging levels:
```python
conf.verb = 0  # Suppress Scapy output
```

---

### Notes and Best Practices
1. **Run as Administrator:** Scapy requires elevated privileges to send and sniff packets.
2. **Protocol Understanding:** Familiarize yourself with network protocols for effective use.
3. **Dependency Issues:** Ensure all dependencies (e.g., `tcpdump`) are installed and configured.
